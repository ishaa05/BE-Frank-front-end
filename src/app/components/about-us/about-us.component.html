  <h2>Vidyadaan Sahayyak Mandal</h2>
  <p>
    Vidyadaan Sahayyak Mandal, Thane (VSM Thane) is a non-profit organization founded in 2008 to support
    needy and deserving students in fulfilling their dream of higher education by providing emotional and professional 
    support, rather than just sponsoring academic fees.
  </p>
  <p>
    VSM has developed its own grooming model where personality development and social awareness are equally important 
    as academic and professional development. We aim to create a sense of community and connection while helping students 
    develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

  <h3>Our Initiatives</h3>

    One of our most popular initiatives is the 'Be Frank' program, which started in 2013 as a free and frank interaction 
    with students of VSM Hostel and has since grown into a program focused on fostering a progressive mindset in students.
